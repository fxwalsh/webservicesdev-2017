#Get Git

####Windows OS 
If you're on Windows, download the  **GitHub Desktop**, from [here](https://desktop.github.com/) which includes Git, and use the Git Shell for your terminal.


####Mac 
You can install Git automatically. To do this, open the Terminal application from spotlight and type `git`. This will prompt Git to install the rest of the command line tools for Git. This should only take a few minutes. It will ask if you would like to download Xcode, which you can ignore.

####Linux

You can use the basic package-management tool that comes with your distribution. For Fedora use:

``$ sudo yum install git-all``

For Debian-based distributions use:

``$ sudo apt-get install git-all``
