# Node.js

If you do not have Node.js installed in you machine, please go to [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) and download/install node for your platform. To check if node is working, open a command line/terminal window on your machine and enter ``node -v``. IT should respond as follows:
```
> node -v
v0.13.0-pre
``` 
The work for this lab has been tested with node version 0.13.0.
