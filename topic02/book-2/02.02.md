# Defining the contacts web API

In the last lab we created one simple route:
```javascript
//add route for /greeting 
app.get('/greeting',function (request, response) {
  ...
});
```
In this lab, the following list of actions are required for the Contacts API. 

- view all contacts
- add a new contact
- delete a contact
- update a contact

We will now map these action to a set of HTTP operations on resources. 

| HTTP Verb & Path | Operation Description |
| -- | -- |
| GET: /api/contacts |return a list of contacts |
| POST: /api/contacts |add a new contact |
| PUT: /api/contacts/:id | update a contact |
| DELETE: /api/contacts/:id | delete a contact |
We will now use the same approach but use the 'require' functionality to separate out the routing logic from the main app script.
